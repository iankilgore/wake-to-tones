  <p>Welcome to the tone alarm clock!  One of the most official alarm clocks for not waking up your parents.</p>
    <h3>how to use it</h3>
  <p>First, find a tone that you like, make sure you can hear it as these are sounds that as you get older, you will not be
able to hear.  Next, once you've found the tone that you like, assuming that you're a kid, test it on your parents to make sure
they cannot hear it.  If you can hear it but your parents can't, you're all set, simply set the alarm when you prefer to wake and
this online tone alarm clock will wake you at that desired time.</p>
<p>
  Make sure that when you're testing this, go in a room where your parents will not invade you testing these, otherwise you're out
  of luck. The lower you go with the tones, the more likely it is for your parents to hear. If your parents are 30-35 years old,
  we recommend using somewhere between 16-18KHz, 35-40: 15KHz+, 40-45: 14KHz+, 45-50: 13KHz+. What if you're staying with your
  grandmother?  Great question, you could probably use even 10KHz. There is no guarantee that she will not hear it, to be on the
  safe side, use 11KHz or 12KHz. Grandpa? Probably the same. We are not responsible for too low of fequencies played, accidental
  low frequencies being played, we do not recommend doing this if you have very strict parents as they may punish you for trying
  to sneak up on them. Also, these tones can drive some people crazy, so PLEASE, use at your own risk. </p>
